# Mindwtr 0.6.2

## Highlights
- Inbox processing is more robust on both desktop and mobile: long titles/descriptions no longer hide key actions.
- Mobile capture overlay now fills the screen correctly even with the keyboard open.
- Desktop checklist items in the details view can now be checked off directly.
- Attachment sync is more reliable by ensuring attachment files and `cloudKey`s are prepared before sync writes.
- Special thanks to **@karl1990** for sponsoring the project. Your support helps keep Mindwtr free and open.

## Desktop
- Avoid auto-focusing long titles in Inbox Processing so the input does not jump to the end.
- Allow checklist items to be toggled directly from the details view.
- Improve sync reliability by pre-syncing attachments before the main sync write.
- Enable the Tauri FS watch feature needed by the sync file watcher.

## Mobile
- Reset title focus when switching tasks in Inbox Processing to keep long titles left-aligned.
- Cap Inbox Processing description height so action buttons remain reachable.
- Fix capture backdrop gaps when the software keyboard is visible.
- Improve notification permission handling when the system requires opening settings.
- Improve sync reliability by pre-syncing attachments before the main sync write.

## Sync & Attachments
- Pre-sync attachments before `data.json` is written so `cloudKey`s are included in the synced data.
- Reduce cases where attachments exist locally but cannot be opened on another device.
