# Mindwtr v0.4.7

## Highlights
- **Inbox Processing (Desktop + Mobile):** Added a dedicated **Refine** step (edit title/description first) to reduce cognitive load and keep later steps read‑only.
- **Kanban Board:** Adaptive column widths again so the board scales across monitors while still allowing horizontal scroll when needed.
- **Task Editor (Desktop):** Editor now scrolls internally so Save/Cancel never disappear off‑screen.
- **Quick Capture Hotkey (Linux):** Default global shortcut updated to **Ctrl+Alt+M** for better WM compatibility.

## Sync & Storage
- SQLite remains the primary local store with JSON sync/backup bridge for file sync workflows.

## Recurrence & Scheduling
- Weekly BYDAY handling improved (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri). 
- Fluid recurrence continues to roll from completion while preserving start/due behavior.

## Localization
- Expanded language support (including Spanish, German, Japanese, and more).

## Misc
- Added tests for core date/recurrence logic and a mobile component smoke test.

If you spot any issues, please file an issue with debug logs enabled (Settings → Sync → Diagnostics).
